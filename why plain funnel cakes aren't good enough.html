        A staple of fairs and festivals, funnel cakes are amazing. But a simple plain funnel cake, maybe
        coated in powdered sugar, is not enough. <highlight>You need to add toppings to make it truly special.</highlight>

        It needs to be topped with whipped cream, ice cream, chocolate syrup, and/or strawberries. You can even add
        sprinkles or nuts. The combination of the warm, crispy funnel cake with the cold toppings creates
        a contrast that is so vital to what funnel cakes fundamentally are. The sweetness of the toppings complements the
        fried dough, creating the perfect balance of flavors.
